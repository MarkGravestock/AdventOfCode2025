- This is a shape packing problem.

##### Part 1

- Brute Force approach - DFS with backtracking.
- The example requirement number 3 is computationally too intensive.
  - But the actual data works fine.

- There are some other approaches that look at the characteristic of the data
 - E.g. simple checks that 
   1. area of presents not > area of region
   2. see if our 3x3 presents will simply fit in the region 

##### Part 2
- Well that was easy having 23 stars allows you to get 24!!

## Day 10

### Key Algorithms

ILP

#### Part 1

- Brute Force approach - Testing combination of button presses to get desired output

#### Part 2

- Realised that the brute force approach was not feasible for part 2 (adding try limiting the number of tries)
- Integer Linear Programming approach to satisfy the constraints
- Google OR-Tools used as the solver

[Google OR Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization)

### Notes

Need to explore ILP as optimisation technique eg:

- Hotel room booking
- Class Timetabling
- Staff Scheduling

Compare with 
- [Timefold](https://docs.timefold.ai/timefold-solver/latest/optimization-algorithms/overview)
- [Microsoft Z3](https://microsoft.github.io/z3guide/docs/optimization/asmallcasestudy)

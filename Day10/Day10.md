### Day 10

#### Key Algorithms

##### Part 1

- Brute Force approach

##### Part 2

- Integer Linear Programming approach to satisy the constraints
- Microsoft Z3 used as the solver

#### Notes

Need to explore ILP as optimisation technique eg:

- Hotel room booking
- Class Timetabling
- Staff Scheduling

Compare with 
- [Timefold](https://docs.timefold.ai/timefold-solver/latest/optimization-algorithms/overview)
- [Google OR Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization)

## Advent of Code 2025

Things to look at

### Day 5

- Implementation in Test Classes

### Day 9

- Use NetTopologySuite to bounds check rectangle
  - Maybe unnecessary for simmpler cases
- For Part 2 as I'd initially just checked 2 corners points (rather than the rectangle polygon) it failed
- Creating a visualation help identify the problem (Others seem to have done the same thing)

### Day 10

- Study ILP
- Alternative non ILP approaches to Part 2

#### Day 11
- Possible to optimise by calculating seperate routes for each segement
  - See [Day11.md](./Day11/Day11.md)
